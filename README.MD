# Clock and Countdown for [rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/)

Thing I made for my desktop.

Someone else made the clock. idk who ... but the license they left doesnt seem to make that matter. I modified the clock a bit and then added another element? to do countdowns to certain dates.

I might change the fonts for the countdowns.
